          Whether you've been aware of it or not, your <br />
          brain has been telling you a story about your <br />
          own life. It's been telling you a story about <br />
          who you are, what your personality is like, what <br />
          your strengths and weaknesses are, how likely <br />
          you are to stick to certain habits, and how <br />
          easily you give up on taking care of yourself. <br />
          Maybe it's been telling you a story about how <br />
          success and happiness are for other people, not <br />
          you. You're kind of doomed to repeat your same <br />
          old mistakes. You're not very good at sticking <br />
          to habits. You don't really commit to changing <br />
          your life for the better.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>0:32</strong><br />
          Maybe the life that you thought is the one that <br />
          you wanted to live, just isn't in the cards for <br />
          you. Maybe your brain has been telling you that <br />
          you're a shy person, or an extroverted person. <br />
          Maybe it's been telling you that you suck at <br />
          public speaking and you get way too nervous. And <br />
          you would never do that. You could never speak <br />
          in front of thousands of people. Some people are <br />
          extremely aware of the fact that their brain <br />
          tells them certain stories. Other people live <br />
          their life kind of oblivious to this. They just <br />
          think that things are the way that they are.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>1:00</strong> <br />
          They think the way that they think they believe <br />
          the things that they believe. And this is <br />
          actually kind of a problem for a lot of people <br />
          if you remain unaware of the fact that your <br />
          brain is constantly crafting a narrative about <br />
          your life, your tendencies, the people around <br />
          you, and the role that you play in the universe. <br />
          And we can't escape these stories forming, it's <br />
          because our subconscious is extremely <br />
          perceptive. Your subconscious picks up on <br />
          basically everything. I've m ntioned on this <br />
          channel before that over 90% of our overall <br />
          mental function is subconscious.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>1:32</strong><br />
          That's kind of the consensus for psychologists <br />
          these days. Bottom line is that we are <br />
          constantly observing, picking up and taking note <br />
          of every sight and smell, every taste and <br />
          texture, everything that everyone says about <br />
          you, either in front of your face or behind your <br />
          back, every small success and bitter failure is <br />
          woven into this story that you tell yourself <br />
          about yourself. And we believe this story. You <br />
          know, we kind of have no choice. We have to pick <br />
          up on patterns otherwise the world seems too <br />
          chaotic.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>2:02</strong><br />
          But I think the problem is that what we think <br />
          happened often isn't what actually happened. We <br />
          are a highly emotional creatures. We interpret <br />
          things with a lot of subjectivity, and a lot of <br />
          these opinions were formed when we were so young <br />
          that we didn't even really have the ability to <br />
          think rationally. You know, if your older <br />
          brother decides to play with the cool kid on the <br />
          block instead of you, as the younger brother, <br />
          you might feel really left out and you might <br />
          think that nobody likes you or nobody cares <br />
          about you. And if a couple more situations like <br />
          this start to happen, it can really start to <br />
          develop a belief that you are not worth hanging <br />
          out with.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>2:37</strong><br />
          You know, no one really likes you. You're not <br />
          worthy of love. And you'll carry that with you <br />
          subconsciously through life, having no idea that <br />
          that belief is there or why it's there, but it <br />
          will serve as sort of a fundamental character <br />
          trait woven into your story. And it gets even <br />
          trickier because human beings really like to <br />
          stay consistent with this story since it is the <br />
          fundamental framework, the lens in which we view <br />
          the world and make sense of things so things <br />
          don't seem so utterly chaotic.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>3:07</strong><br />
          When new information is provided to us that <br />
          contradicts that story, we tend to reject it. We <br />
          will throw out new information in favor of ideas <br />
          that help confirm our cognitive bias, things in <br />
          line with the story that we've always told. And <br />
          that really sucks because a lot of the time, a <br />
          lot of the time, the stories we tell ourselves <br />
          don't serve us. We might think it serves us <br />
          because we think it's the truth because we <br />
          haven't questioned it.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>3:34</strong><br />
          But the proof of its efficacy is in the pudding. <br />
          You know, if you're not where you want to be in <br />
          life, if you feel unsatisfied on a day-to-day <br />
          basis, if you don't have a sense of inner peace <br />
          or satisfaction with what you do or the state of <br />
          the world or the state of yourself, there's a <br />
          good chance that your story isn't serving you. <br />
          So what's the solution? Well, thankfully, <br />
          there's this thing called Neuroplasticity, which <br />
          is kind of a general umbrella term that refers <br />
          to the brain's ability to modify change and <br />
          adapt both structure and function throughout <br />
          life and in response to experience.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>4:10</strong><br />
          And if you think about it, this is probably the <br />
          most optimistic psychological discovery in <br />
          history for people who don't really like the way <br />
          that they behave, or the thought patterns that <br />
          they tend to dive into. And that's because by <br />
          introducing new stimulus or getting new <br />
          experiences or behaving in a different way over <br />
          time can actually change the literal structure <br />
          of your brain so that those changes become <br />
          permanent.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>4:36</strong><br />
          You can redesign your brain in a way that better <br />
          serves you. And really the only thing stopping <br />
          you is cognitive bias and cognitive dissonance. <br />
          And the fact that to behave in a different way, <br />
          in a way that isn't the way that you've always <br />
          acted, it's gonna feel uncomfortable. It's gonna <br />
          feel unnatural. It's gonna feel like it's not <br />
          really you doing these things. But I can <br />
          guarantee you that if you do these things long <br />
          enough, it's not just some sort of overused <br />
          empty platitude that these things will start to <br />
          feel more natural.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>5:07</strong><br />
          They will. Those things will start to feel like <br />
          you. By doing these things over a long period of <br />
          time, your subconscious that is always watching <br />
          starts to actually develop evidence that you are <br />
          this way. By acting in this new way, in the <br />
          present moment, day after day, eventually that <br />
          present becomes the past. And when your <br />
          subconscious looks over your life, you have <br />
          evidence from the past and the present of this <br />
          new behavior in this new lifestyle and it can <br />
          predict and assume confidently that you are <br />
          capable of continuing this lifestyle and you are <br />
          capable of change going on into the future.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>5:41</strong><br />
          So it all starts with awareness. It all starts <br />
          by taking a step back and trying to figure out <br />
          what story your brain is telling yourself about <br />
          yourself? Who are you according to you? What <br />
          things do you usually do? And what behaviors do <br />
          you engage in day to day that reaffirms that <br />
          belief?<br />
          <br />
          <strong>6:00</strong><br />
          And how can you modify those behaviors to better <br />
          serve you so that when your subconscious <br />
          naturally does its thing and observes your <br />
          behavior, it has some evidence to go off of that <br />
          you are indeed this new person, you are indeed <br />
          the person that you actually intentionally want <br />
          to be this time, rather than the person that you <br />
          kind of ended up as by accident. Since the <br />
          beginning of time, human beings have used <br />
          stories to help them make sense of the world <br />
          around them. We are compelled by stories when <br />
          someone tells a funny joke, or when we all <br />
          flocked to the movie theater to see the new <br />
          Spider-Man.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>6:34</strong><br />
          And for that reason, I highly recommend the <br />
          book, "The Science of Storytelling" by Will <br />
          Storr. I'm currently listening to this gem on <br />
          Audible, which is today's video sponsor. And <br />
          it's helping me realize that there's an actual <br />
          formula to storytelling. So if you're interested <br />
          in being a more engaging speaker, you just wanna <br />
          tell funnier jokes at the dinner table, or maybe <br />
          you wanna get into creative writing or script <br />
          writing, check out this incredible audiobook and <br />
          all of the other amazing audiobooks that you can <br />

          COVID. I got hit by COVID pretty hard. And we've <br />
          been dealing with COVID this month so we got a <br />
          last minute rush at the end of this month. <br />
          That's why there's two videos back to back <br />
          because I'm just working overtime here editing <br />
          this. I forgot to do an outro. And I am mentally <br />
          stable, very mentally stable. I'm thriving, <br />
          actually.<br />

          point, I'm just like cranking the watch time of <br />

          long enough. Yeah, just trying to soak in that <br />
          Ad Sense.<br />

          perfectly comfortable with being cringe. I'm <br />
          fully aware of the cringe levels right now. <br />
